# NFL Season Analytics Dashboard üèàüìä
### Overview

This project tracks the 2025 NFL season in real time using Python for data collection and Excel for visualization. It automatically pulls game statistics from ESPN‚Äôs API and generates a CSV that feeds into an interactive Excel dashboard.

The dashboard makes it easy to explore how each team is performing with filters for:
- Week
- Conference & Division
- Home/Away splits
- Game results (Win/Loss/Tie)

Metrics include scoring, total yards, passing/rushing performance, turnovers, and more.

### Tools & Skills

- Python (requests, pandas, regex) for data extraction and cleaning
- Excel for interactive dashboards with slicers and pivot tables

### Files in this Repo

- espn_nfl_update.py ‚Üí Python script that pulls NFL data from ESPN and saves it to CSV
- nfl_data.csv ‚Üí Sample dataset (automatically generated by the script)
- 2025 NFL Season Dashboard.xlsx ‚Üí Excel dashboard with slicers and visuals
- README.md ‚Üí Documentation (this file)

### Why This Project?
I built this project to combine my love for sports with my skills in Python and Excel. As a former athlete with a STEM background, I believe that stats and data can help tell a story about a game, and give real insights into how and why teams are able to succeed on the field. This project was a way to combine that passion with my technical skills. I wanted to build a dashboard that anyone could use to quickly understand team performance.
